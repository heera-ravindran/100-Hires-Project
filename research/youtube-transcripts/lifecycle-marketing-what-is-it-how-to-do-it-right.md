## Transcript

Most marketing teams think about

customer engagement as a campaign. Run

it for a month, try something new, move

on. This session is about what happens

when you stop doing that. Sue Cho at

Monarch Money tested promoting their

referral program during free trial

before users had even become paid

members. Then the numbers came back. 64%

increase in referral shares, 50%

increase in paid subscribers via

referrals. Then she expanded from mobile

to desktop and added another half

million dollars in ARR. Jonathan at

Seamless AI stopped treating customer

engagement like a marketing channel and

built a full 365day behavioral driven

program across email, inapp, SMS, and

live training. They also built an AI

support agent trained on 3,000 hours of

content that's deflecting 55% of support

tickets. And Naomi from Customerio

walked through how their own team uses a

simple feedback email loop to close the

gap between what customers need and what

actually ends up on the product roadmap.

We got into the data behind when

customers are most likely to refer

someone else. What it actually takes to

run an AI agent without going off the

rails today. Why behavioral triggers

beat timebased sequences and how to turn

customer education into a real marketing

strategy. Dan hosted this one. Dan's a

CEO at Exit 5. I was somewhere playing

golf probably. He hosted this live

session and we do them twice a month. We

do deep dives with experts around all

topics in B2B marketing. This one was

all about customer engagement, customer

marketing, lifestyle marketing, whatever

you call it. This is a great

conversation. If you need to get better

at marketing to your existing customers,

don't miss this episode. Here it is.

Enjoy this Exit 5 live session all about

customer engagement.

>> Let's get rolling here. Uh Allison, I'm

going to have you share that slide for

us. Um before we get into today's

session about customer engagement, um

first of all, I have three great

panelists here uh that are going to join

and each present some uh very specific

each is bringing we we spent 30 minutes

together earlier this week and each is

bringing stats uh examples, visuals,

they're bringing all the the stuff that

you want to see about what these

companies are doing in terms of customer

engagement, in terms of uh you know

turning their customers into a

superpower for their business. Um, but

before we get into that, I want to tell

you a little bit of our friends at

Customer IO. Um, they are sponsor for

today's session. They help marketers

turn firstparty data into engaging

customer experiences across email, SMS,

and push. Um, it's built for marketers

who actually care about the craft, not

just blasting the same message to

everyone on the list on a Tuesday

morning. Uh, guilty of doing that in my

past life for sure. uh because uh the

best marketers like all of you who

showed up today um are trying to figure

out customer engagement for growth and

you know that uh not a lot of people are

talking about how to engage your

customers for growth. Um uh they're not

just handling customers off to CS or

moving on. Uh they're treating it like a

real channel. Customer helps you do just

that by unifying your data messaging and

AI into one platform. So every

interaction with your customers is

stronger and more relevant than the

last. They also survived survived man.

Let me take one more sip of coffee here.

They also surveyed 750 marketers,

product managers, growth leaders, and

engineers and put together this great

resource for all of you about how their

teams are engaging with customers right

now. It's the best way to engage with

customers in 2026. They put all that

together in a report for you. It's

linked here in in I don't know where it

is in here. It's linked somewhere in

here. You'll look for it. You'll find

it. Um but if you don't find it, their

team is going to send it to you after.

Um it's a it's a great report. You

should check that out. And with without

any further ado, we will jump into our

first uh presenter. Sue is going to join

uh on the stage here, Sue from Monarch,

and she's going to tell you a little bit

about a referral program and some

surprising data that she got um from

running a test uh fairly recently. So

Sue, welcome. Welcome to uh Exit 5 Live.

Nice to have you here.

>> Hi Dan, thanks for having me.

>> Uh do you want to share your screen and

get right into it? I I like to go right

for it. We're four minutes into the top

of the hour. We're ready to show some

some stats and examples and screenshots

and talk about this flow that you built.

>> Sure. So, the example today that I'm

going to share is for our referral

program. We revamped our referral

program from a credit based system where

we give you Monarch money credits um to

a gift card system. So, we were trying

to figure out the optimal time to um

promote our referral program. And

initially, I think most people would

think like, hey, someone should be a

paid subscriber and have been using the

product a while to be committed enough

to want to refer a another friend. Uh,

we were wrong. Um, we had our data

partners do an analysis of when people

refer the most and shockingly it happens

during trial, especially the first day

of their them starting their trial. So,

I was skeptical, but I went ahead and

tested um an inapp message, which I'll

share one second.

So, we built we built this mobile inapp

message to display to people who have

just started a trial and data also

showed us that they need to have at

least one financial account connected.

Again, just a reminder, Monarch Money is

a financial aggregator app. Um, so if

someone has at least one account

connected and they've started a trial,

it's a good signal that they're ready to

refer someone. Um, and how we built this

flow.

Me one second.

And here's customer IO. Hopefully

everyone can see this. Um, but this is

how I built this in customer.io. uh we

have every event streaming into customer

io via segment. So with the the trigger

of this workflow that I built was a free

trial started trigger. And the next step

you see there's a wait until condition.

I think this is pretty cool. I've been

doing email for about 16 years and I

really haven't seen um a filter like

this. But it says wait until and it

basically listens for a credential sync

to happen. So users will stay in this

state after a free trial starts until

they do this. If they don't, they don't

move um along. Um and we check to see

make sure that they haven't shared a

referral already and then we go back to

showing this in message.

>> So someone signs up for a trial sue of

of Monarch. It's uh it used to be time

based, right? And now it's based on this

condition. It's wait till they hit the

condition. Is that how it one of the

changes? No, we actually had uh no no

referral program during trial. We didn't

want to touch it.

>> Okay. We came from nothing. Yeah.

>> Yeah.

>> And so mission was like can we get some

of these people that are trying our

product or or your first hypothesis was

this isn't going to work because you

need an aha moment for people to like be

a customer and love and find a feature

to actually refer someone. But what you

found was this offer

>> and it was right after they sign up for

a trial to like you know use Monarch

offer to share it with a friend. this

had what was the increase in in lift and

referrals that you got?

>> Uh so we take a very scientific approach

to all of our experiments. We had to

write a hypothesis. We had to do a

basian analysis on how long this will

take. Um so I estimated a 20% lift. The

actual was a 64% increase in referral

share during trial. And that's not all

we look at. We look at the downstream

effects. And the downstream effect was

we had a 50% increase in paid

subscribers via referral.

>> Wow. And and so this is mobile but but

one thing so you were telling about was

like I think you had this discovery

after was it after this initial test

mobile that this might work on desktop

as well.

>> Yeah. So this was a twofold. So phase

one of this was just introducing

referrals to our trial audience which

>> shockingly it worked. So we continue

>> um and then we always try to optimize

what we're running. So we

I think I was just thinking about this

on a weekend as we do and it just I had

an aha moment myself like wait I'm

showing this on mobile except yeah most

of our free trial traffic is coming from

web because now we're trying to push

people to a Stripe payment instead of

Apple and Google so we don't have to pay

the Apple and Google tax. Uh when I

looked at the actual mix, it was 80% of

our traffic is starting their free trial

starts on um a desktop app. So we

decided

to expand uh this inapp message not just

on mobile but also on web. And this is

the customer IO screen that I use.

Choose your destination. They make it

really simple. You just choose your

platform, web, iOS, Android. Obviously,

our devs had to connect all of this and

specify the page that you wanted to show

on.

>> And so, we did it.

Boom. And

>> and that's the desktop version. Yeah,

>> this is the desktop version of the inapp

message or a popup, whatever you want to

call it. Um, and with this, we had some

pretty pretty incredible um results from

this. Uh ultimately we wanted to look at

how many referral like was there a

percentage lift in the referral shared

um as well as downstream effects on AR

and incremental subscribers. So what we

found here was there was a 16% relative

lift in referral shared um and that

ultimately led to I'm sorry let me look

at the numbers.

Yeah, it was a 20% increase in referrals

redeemed and that equated and another

interesting thing that we found was that

users who actually send a referral

during trial have a higher likelihood to

convert from trial to paid.

>> That was a secondary metric that we were

not expecting. And once we did all the

calculations there on the incremental

lift, it equated to about a half a

million ARR lift. Um,

>> wow.

>> Yeah, not expecting that at all. Uh, so

that was a big win for us.

>> That's that's uh that's pretty

incredible. You think about like the

psychology though of like, okay, if I'm

going to tell someone I know about this

app and I'm going to get some incentive

to do it, obviously it's why I'm going

to start by doing it. But if I'm going

to like make that commit, like I'm going

to show someone else like, hey, you

should use this, too. Like you might, it

makes sense. you might be a little bit

more tend towards like, all right, I'm

going to use this or I'm gonna I'm gonna

be more committed to trying out this app

and making it work, which is awesome.

Um, okay, we got a question from Jacobo

Jakabo, I'm sorry if I'm mispronounce

mispronouncing your name. Was this lift

due to the change from credits to gift

cards? And what made your the question

credits in the first place?

>> What made you question, excuse me, the

the the credits in the first place? Was

it a credits or was it more of a

placement of when the the referrals came

up?

>> It was literally credits. It was Monarch

credit so you can use it toward your

next Monarch subscription. We did not

feel that it was strong enough. Our

referral channel wasn't pulling um I

like to think of referral referral being

the top three acquisition sources.

>> Um it wasn't landing there. So uh we had

a huge change in the growth team. We had

a new uh CGO come in and just shake up

the program. Uh the lift wasn't due to

this change because we never tested it

against the trial audience. We never

pushed referrals to our trial audience.

>> Um so the lift was purely just taking

this moment in time that we knew from

data was a good time to promote this and

shooting it off. We actually honestly to

be clear um we didn't see that huge of a

lift when we went from a credit system

to a gift card system. We thought, we

had a hypothesis that people would

prefer a gift card where they can use it

for whatever uh versus Monarch Credit,

but that actually didn't really lift

referrals. What is helping our referral

program right now is the way we're

marketing it.

>> Okay.

Um, other questions, if people have

other questions, I I should have said

this at the top, but feel free to jump

in on the chat panel. I'll check the Q&A

panel

for some reason. I see Jill asked, "What

type of tools do you track to me to uh

for your metrics and measurements?" Uh,

customer.io. Uh, definitely. Uh, but

that feeds directly into Amplitude. I'm

a big Amplitude fan girl. So, for us,

what uh on the marketer side, I build

funnels that say, "Hey, this inapp

message was delivered. How many people

shared a referral?" Which we have as an

event within 7 days. 7-day window is

what we like to look at. Um and on the

data side they use statig to do all the

in-depth statistical analysis.

Yes. And every like we have to wait for

uh statistical significance. So

everything is squeaky clean on the data

front.

>> Other questions? Feel free to jump in

here. Um, Sue, tell us about your

background. Like, how did you Oops.

Sorry, I'm getting a little bit of an

error here.

Can you still hear me, Sue?

>> I can hear you.

>> Okay. Sorry, my I don't know if it's my

internet or or something here, but um

the Tell us about your background. How

did you get into this? How did you end

up doing growth at at Monarch?

>> Oh my gosh. Uh, so I've been doing

growth, retention, engagement, email

marketing work for the past 16, 17

years. Um, yes. So, I've been doing

this.

>> Yeah. Where else have you done up beyond

Mark?

>> Uh, so my expertise is in um

subscription ecom. Uh, my first job, oh

my goodness, I'm going to date myself

here, but my first job um in this

department was

>> in online dating and this was pre-app

online dating. So, a website like e-har.

>> Is that dating yourself? I don't know. I

don't

>> Is it Is it

dating? Um,

>> okay. the era of OkayCid, but I don't

know if anyone knows uh the website J

Date. It's for

>> Yes.

>> Yes. Jate.

>> My wife's Jewish. Yeah.

>> I didn't meet her on Jay Date, but my

wife is Jewish, so yes, I I do know Jay

Date. Yeah.

>> Everyone knows someone who met on Jate

was our was our catchphrase there. Um

>> I like that.

>> Yeah. But they actually

>> someone just said heart emojis. I don't

know who it just showed up on our

screen. Someone sending the heart emojis

to us.

>> Amazing for that. But okay, so you

started in in in e-commerce uh and then

also online dating apps. What what was

your first role there? What were you

doing for them?

>> I was an email operations coordinator.

So that's where I learned all the

technical. By the way, just so you guys

know, I'm a team of one at Monarch Money

and Life Cycle. So I'm the one that

builds all these workflows. I'm the one

that directly works with the data

partners. Um my first job is where I got

most of that experience. I was a

technical coordinator. So they had me

build all the segments, work with all

the engineers. And this is why startups

love me because I can build the things,

I can do the strategy, I can do the

data. Um yeah, never did I think being a

coordinator at J Date would land me on a

16 17 year trajectory of this role. But

I love it. Um before before Monarch

Money, I was doing the same thing at

calm like calm down the calm down like

calm app meditation and stuff.

>> Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I used to use that

for like a minute but Okay. You're at

Okay. So you you have a ton of nonB2B

background in marketing which is really

interesting because we we bring a lot of

people with B2B marketing background to

us. And so, um, uh, this this type of

stuff is, I think, what a lot of beauty

marketers or some group obviously who

are here today want to know more about,

especially like on the push and the, you

know, SMS and email side. So, it's

really awesome to to hear a little bit

about your background and and some of

your experience there.

>> Awesome. Thank you, Dan.

>> Cool. All right. There's no further

questions for Sue as of now. If you do

have a question, Sue is going to be

backstage. She will answer your

questions in chat. Um, a heads up my if

I lose anybody or I can't click anything

on my screen right now. I'm not sure and

I don't want to lose you all. So, I'm

just going to keep going here. Um, if uh

Allison could send up I believe Jonathan

is going to go next. Um, we will keep

rolling here. And if for some reason I

disappear, I apologize for that. I'll

get back as soon as possible. But it

seems to be working for now. So, um,

we'll just keep it running and we'll

have Jonathan join here for a second.

Um, and Jonathan's gonna talk about a

couple cool things. Johnson, uh, we

talked yesterday or we talked th

Wednesday, you shared a very specific

example and a very specific sort of like

a couple of different sets of stats and

and and things you wanted to show and it

was very clear-cut. And then this

morning, Jonathan sent us like five

slides with like 10 different charts,

all these different graphics. It looks

like he spent all night working on an

update because he wanted to show you

everything he knows. And Seamus is a

very interesting business. He's gonna

tell you a little bit about it.

Jonathan, thanks for for joining.

Excited to kind of go through some of

the stuff with you today. Yeah. No, I

appreciate it. Uh recognize a lot of

folks in the chat as well. So really my

goal here like this webinar uh is all

about not only how to acquire customers,

right? We we do that every day, but how

do you keep customers uh and the

marketing playbook that goes behind

that? So at first I was going to share

like one strategy that works for us. And

then I thought, you know what, why don't

we take a couple plays out of the

playbook. So, my goal here is that maybe

one of them resonates with you and you

can take it back to your uh take it back

to your desk and maybe it'll work. Who

knows? Uh but I'm here to answer

questions. So, I'm going to go through a

few plays uh that we use at our own

organization. Some context. Uh this will

really help too. So, when you're seeing

this stuff, you're like, "What?" Um team

of 12, not a team of one. Sue, props to

you, by the way. That is some awesome

work that you're doing over there. Um,

we love Segment Amplitude and our

customer IO stack as well for real. Uh,

they're doing some really cool things.

Um, but my team focuses on end toend

marketing. We focus on the entire

customer journey and a little bit of of

more. So, we have your classic demand

genen, we've got content, we've got

creative, I have a dev, but uh, we also

have customer education that lives on

the marketing team.

>> And I'll explain a little bit in terms

of why that's important. Product

marketing is also absorbed by the

marketing team. We also handle

recruitment marketing. So, we're not

only recruiting for uh new users and

trials and customers for the platform

and the software. We're also recruiting

for the people that are going to work

for us to help us get more of those

things as well, including retaining

customers. So, we have our hands full,

but um that's what you do. You take the

opportunities as they are presented to

you. So, a little bit different from

organizations that I worked with in the

past. And what's also different is the

way that we're compensated. Um, however

you want to put it, MBO, bonus,

commission. Um, we're compensated on uh

three pillars. Net new revenue makes

sense. Um, net revenue retention or NRR,

which is like revenue retained over a

period of time. You want to try to get

that as high as possible. Ultimately,

more than what you were originally

getting in the year prior. and um and

profitability, right? Profitability of

the business. We've got one of the

larger line items across the org. So,

the money and budgeting is part of my

role, uh including the activation of

campaigns like I'm about to share with

you. Um and then our motion, this is

kind of what's a little bit different

from orgs that I've worked with at the

past. We have a million users on the

platform. We have 18,000 paying

organization and about 40,000 paying

users from those organizations. So um

things move very quickly uh at seamless.

Uh our velocity is very fast. It's a

premium motion. A lot of data comes in

and out all the time. And the really

cool thing about that is that we're able

to see things happen very quickly when

we test for better or for worse. So I'm

going to share

>> million users. You got got statistical

significance all day long. Right. It is

and and um like I mentioned it sometimes

works in our favor and sometimes you

know what you learn very quickly and

both of those things are a gift right

>> so I'm on my two screens here I'm going

to pop mine up and kind of go over a few

of the plays that work for us

share let's go with the presentation

share screen we go I promise I I

practiced this earlier I promise

and then we'll go to

Perfect.

So, here we go. Let's share some plays.

Here we go. Oh,

we've got our charts, right? We're going

to go back one. So, because things are

moving so quickly throughout the funnel,

right, we have tens of thousands of

users that are leveraging the platform

every week. We're not only focused on

just the top of the funnel. Um, we're

also focused on retaining customers,

growing customers, and of course in

partnership with sales and CS. This is

just a little bit of a snapshot. And

really the point that I wanted to uh

make here is that when I came on top

when I came to the organization almost

six years ago, um, you know, we we did

things like most orgs I've worked with

in the past do when you acquire new

customers, new users, and such. you

throw them over the fence and let CS

deal with it, right? And um that was

okay, you know, for a very very short

period of time. Um but the obvious, you

know, we find out the obvious, right?

Marketing's winning, CS isn't winning or

CS is winning, marketing is not winning.

You always want to win as an

organization, right? And because of

that, um you know, we're all sharing the

same type of goals across the board.

That's why we have NR and profitability

as well as net new. So we stopped

treating uh customer engagement like a

campaign. This was one of the big

takeaways that uh helped impact our

organizations. We we went away from like

campaign, let's do this for this period

of time and then stop and try this new

thing and try that for a period of time

and stop and really went for a full

365day

um uh trigger or let's pay behavioral

driven multi-channel campaign. So, we

stop thinking of things like this month

we're going to do G2 reviews, right?

This month we're going to do uh

testimonials or it's case study week and

it's just baked into the entire

experience that you have uh with our

platform today. And what does that mean?

It means right message, right time,

right place, right? It's a combination

of email, it's a combination of inapp,

it's a combination of SMS and even

personalized outreach and training.

It's a lot, right? But really what we do

and uh customer IO makes that super

easy. Um is that people are getting

those messages when they're engaging

with certain parts of our platform,

right? Uh and I'm going to go into what

some of those parts are and what some of

the results are. You know, one of the

big things for that we realized um you

know, years back is uh users and

customers would come on the platform and

they'd kind of drop off over a period of

time and there was a lot going on within

that period, right? We kind of dropped

them into the platform and said, "Hey,

tool tips, those are fun. Just go go on

your own way." And um we had a lot of

support tickets, a lot of them. and all

these little squiggly lines you're

looking at here. Um,

managing those support tickets is not

scalable at all. So like why is

marketing dealing with this? Because we

are tasked with driving engagement in

the platform as well, right? We want

people to use the product. We want them

to come back. We want them to find

value. Aha moment, whatever PLG acronym

you want to use. Um, and we just

couldn't handle human driven support and

training anymore to a degree. So um what

we built was uh an agent right I think

you hear a lot about these days but this

has been up for about uh two years

almost two years now. So in other words

we created an automation

um chatbot agent if you will using voice

flow and a combination of customer IO

for some of the inapp interactions as

well as some of the email interactions

to literally answer any possible

question there is. you know, in the

past. We you can see the numbers here.

We have what do we have there? Over

7,380

um conversations that have been

mitigated via chat, right? It's a lot of

conversations

uh in this period of time. And those

conversations would have ended up

becoming Jira tickets, which is lame.

Hate, you know, you might love Jira

tickets, right? you send 8,000

customers, 7,000 customers to open a

ticket to get an answer to a question

that uh is very easy to answer and

you're going to end up losing customers.

They're going to turn off your platform.

They're just not going to be as

interested as they would be otherwise.

So, little picture of a little chatbot

Sarah there. Um what makes this

powerful, it's not like, hey, I built an

agent in chatbot. Let's see how it goes.

Is that we invested into this strategy.

We have an a full-time um AI engineer

that works specifically on our chatbot

as well as some of our other automations

and workflows, but training this thing

and keeping it trained and on task and

not hallucinating is almost a full-time

job. And I think you're starting to hear

that more and more as people are

adopting it for a longer period of time.

You know, agents and AI, right? Um you

can't just let this run loose. You have

to train it. So, it's trained with over,

you know, 3,000 hours of our training

videos, our articles, our entire

knowledge base. It constantly has to be

retrained, refreshed. Um, with the

amount of conversations that we get,

there's always a new question that it

can't answer every day. We don't let it

run off the rails. We have guard rails

for it so it doesn't try to make stuff

up. And trust me, people try to do that

all the time, especially when it comes

to pricing. Not going to let it happen.

Um, but the results so far, I mean,

we've seen a deflection rate on our on

our uh tickets by about 55%. For us,

it's meaningful, right? That's thousands

and thousands and thousands of tickets.

But tickets aside, it's thousands of

customers that couldn't get the answers

to the questions that they wanted. Maybe

they were in the knowledge base, but

they didn't want to go through the

knowledge base. Who does, right? We're

able to provide an experience that keeps

them on the platform to this day and

helps them move on. for higher level

escalations. Of course, we have people,

right? But this was a huge win for us.

Uh, and it was a big bet for us, too.

Um, you know, we wouldn't we didn't

really know if this was going to be a

great solution or not. This happened at

a time where at least I was a little bit

skeptical about uh having uh you know,

AI answer questions instead of people.

But, uh, it's been a fantastic job so

far. Jonathan, if I could ask one quick

followup question and I am going to take

the bait because you mentioned something

about AI and of course we can't do

anything without talking about AI. Your

AI engineer, what is their day-to-day

their training their full-time? I mean,

they've got plenty obviously of data to

look at, but I'm kind of just maybe give

us a little bit of like a what is the

day-to-day or kind of a weekly, you

know, schedule look like for them? like

what are they actually doing with is it

is it like you said it's coaching it's

obviously looking at the data but I just

I' I'd love for everyone to hear a

little more about what that AI engineer

actually does on a day-to-day basis for

>> that's uh our guy thief shout out

southeast uh at seamless um

a lot so part of it is the training of

the bot right that's that's relatively

easy a lot of it is analyzing the

questions the answers that are coming

through on a daily basis. Yes, some of

that could be solved with AI, but you

can't quite trust AI all the way. So,

it's a lot of manual intervention in

terms of what's prompting the answers.

How do we readjust the prompts or

readjust the answers based on the

uniqueness of prompts? Um, as well as he

he's also working on some other projects

for us related to uh automations and

workflows within NAD, some of our AI

capabilities within our app. But this is

a big part of his job because uh it's

servicing so many of our customers every

single day and it's the primary way in

which you get support inside of our

platform.

>> Totally. And then Jonathan when we were

talking about this before I think are

you going to talk about training next is

that I want to jump ahead if you want to

talk a little bit about that.

>> Let's see.

I sure am.

>> Yep. Okay. All right then. I'll I'll

just shut up and let you talk us through

this one.

>> All of this is like

at other organizations, right? I

wouldn't really be diving into things

like support and inapp experience and

training, right? My job used to be, this

was a while back now, you get MQLs and

you throw them to sales, right? And then

you're done. Then they throw it over to

CS. Good luck.

>> The good old days.

>> Good old days. I do miss. No, I'm just

kidding. Um so we took that campaign

type of strategy or campaign sort of

point of view on treating customers.

Turn that into a strategy. The same

happened with customer education. So we

turn that from uh hey there's our

knowledge base or here are some videos

you can watch which by the way we have.

Anybody can watch any video on demand.

We have tons of training in the app.

It's all good. We have courses cool

stuff. Um, but at the end of the day, we

found out two things. Um, there's a

subset of customers that just want to be

heard. They just want to get feedback

from a real person. And I can empathize

with that quite a bit. If you've ever

gone through a drive-thru lately and you

got the robot, like, sure, the robot can

take the order, but I'd rather tell a

real person that there's just something

there that I don't quite trust. So, that

aside, uh, we also started treating

customer education as a marketing

strategy. what it really what it comes

down to. It's found two things. One,

they want to talk to real people. Two,

um,

they want to be taught how to do the

things that they need to do in order to

do their job better. That means more

than how to use Seamless. That means

what are sales strategies that are

working today? What are marketing

strategies that are working today? Uh,

having guest speakers on sometimes to

talk a little bit about their

experience. So they're not just hearing

it from us, they're hearing real life

use cases from customers and sometimes

not even customers. We want to bring in

somebody that is uh a trainer in cold

calling. We do that too. Um but we have

live trainings and we started that

around the same time about two years

ago. Uh to date we've done 4,982

customers trained and we do our live

trainings about four times per week.

Sometimes a little less, sometimes a

little more depending on the calendar,

right? But we have trained a lot of

customers. Um, and uh, anybody can take

this, right? It's not just for new

customers. It's not just for enterprise,

right? Um, it's for anybody. If you've

been on the platform for eight months,

you can take a training anytime you

want. If you're a user and you haven't

paid, you can take a live training with

us anytime you want. It's all self-s

serve, up to you. Real people, uh, real

interactions, lots of Q&A, different

themes per day sometimes. You can kind

of see that in our little notion tracker

backboard. Um, we got some on intro, we

got some on our features. It's a big

mix, but uh, it's been another huge win

for us.

>> And I think Jonathan, you had said once

you got this program live, there was a

drop off before after three months.

There's a couple questions I want to get

to in the chat. I'll get to those in

just a second, but there was a drop off

before and then once you implemented

this program, you saw that drop off

start to flatten out. Is that correct?

>> Yes. So we had customers that came in

come out uh of our of our engagement

i.e. out of our app. Um the average for

customers was about three months and

then it would decline and then it would

kind of stay steadily throughout the

period. Meaning they used to be weekly

users, now they're monthly users. Like

we don't necessarily that's not a good

sign if you're uh looking at your uh

your customer engagement, right? It it's

a potential for churn.

>> Yeah. especially, you know, a platform

in the space that we're in. Um, so yes,

uh, as we started to do more live

trainings, hearing our customers out,

providing them with optionality to meet

with real humans, um, as well as, uh,

easy ways to get questions answered

quickly. Um, that has definitely helped

our business out pretty tremendously.

And I'll have a have a a grand reveal of

how it's hitting the bottom line as

well.

>> Perfect. All right, we won't we won't

ruin that. a couple questions that came

up. One from Richard kind of you kind of

just spoke to this because it was I

think it was mostly about the first

three months of their of their journey

with you. But to to bring up Richard's

question, uh curious about your approach

to customer engagement plus education at

the start of a customer's life cycle

versus existing. Uh finding finding

people to join is easier said than done.

So maybe that's a little bit of a

secondary question there, but John,

maybe you could talk to that a little

bit for us.

>> Yeah, none of this is easy. So I hope

it's not coming off that way, right?

Like we don't have full capacity on our

webinars, but um it's it's marketing

within itself, right? It's the marketing

inside marketing. So we have to market

our training, right? People aren't just

going to naturally come. We love when

they do, right? That's a picture of, you

know, a button in the app that they can

always get access to if they want to.

But ultimately we have to market

ourselves and market our training inside

the platform as well as throughout their

journey whether it be on phone calls

with CSMS if they have one through our

um marketing automation uh workflows you

know customer IO and app. We also use

some behavioral triggers too for finding

and we use Amplitude by the way. Awesome

for finding that people are you know um

rage clicking for lack of a better term

on a certain area of the app. maybe

they're hitting these filters over and

over again. We can cohort those

customers and offer them a live training

uh on the spot in the platform. So,

we're able to identify where we think um

users and customers are finding

friction. But yeah, we got to market it.

It's it's not easy. I see the other part

of that too versus existing.

Start is easier than existing. Um start

they have you have all their attention,

right? first month of usage is and

engagement is like 98%.

It's so high and it's just that over

time if you're not constantly getting in

front of your customers, you're not

constantly providing value,

um they're going to drop off. And you

know what? They're going to drop off

anyway. They're not going to be 97%

engagement for the next 12 months, but

you want to mitigate that as much as

possible.

Uh let's let's jump a I'll have uh

Jonathan respond to a couple more of

these questions in in the chat after we

go through it. John, let's go to the

next I want I want your grand reveal. We

want to see some of the grand. Okay,

real quick here. We also drive growth

plays through to for higher net revenue

retention. If you're not doing this

already, identify some of your higher uh

higher value growth accounts um

enterprise accounts, whatever you may

want to call them. This sounds pretty

elementary and it kind of is, but it's

it's really lowhanging fruit. Uh we

market to the users of organizations

that currently haven't signed up to the

platform. That's all this is. And this

works really well for uh larger

organizations, segmented organizations,

buying committees that you want to

market to. I mean, you you run the list

of users that um you know, we happen to

be a data platform, so we benefit from

that. But you find the folks that you

want to be part of the organization that

currently is on your platform and you

market to them wherever they're at,

right? Get them on board. Show them why.

Speak to them differently than you would

a net new customer. It's going to win.

For our growth accounts, it's it's

helped increase 32% uh in NRR uh in 2025

doing that. These are big accounts by

the way. I'll preface that.

>> Yeah, that's

>> results over time.

I am talking a bit. So, I'm going to

wrap it up here. Results over time,

right? Um, we're looking at the very end

of the funnel here. Are we saving more

customers than we're losing? And yeah,

we we go through a lot of customers,

right? Just in general, we bring in tens

of thousands of users per month. We

bring in, you know, thousands of demos

held per month. So, we see a lot come

through. 2024 to 2025 year-over-year uh

change in cancellation cases decreased

by about 24%.

Uh that's big for us. It's people that

say, "You know what? Uh I don't want to

cancel," which is awesome. They want to

renew. We want that. Um and then auto

renewal removed, uh about a 19.9%

decrease. And then overall, it's just

money in the bank to the organization. I

know that's a lot of charts to look at,

but at the end of the day, this is the

net revenue retention number. This is

the retention number, the IBIDA number,

right? We if we maintain more customers,

we're going to have a better chance of

profitability without having to market

to net new um prospects. So, it's been a

win for us. Couple plays. Hope some of

it was helpful. Um understand it could

be a little unique, but happy to share

anything else in the chat. Yeah, based

on the number of questions, Jonathan,

there's there's definitely interested in

in what you just showed. So, uh

hopefully you can answer a couple of

those. Hopefully, at the end, we also

will bring everybody back up on stage

and we'll try to answer some of the

questions. I know there was a question

for Sue that came in earlier. Um we can

try to answer that live at the end. But

Jonathan, thank you very much. We're

going to have you jump backstage for a

minute. Uh and then we have Naomi jump

on stage. Naomi has a really cool role.

Um she works for Customer I.O., but

she's kind of like the power user of

customer IO, the product at Customer

I.O. And and Naomi, you have a pretty

interesting background, too. Maybe we

can start there. A little bit about your

background, what you've done leading up

to your your your employment at

customer.io.

>> Yeah, I'm a career life cycle marketer

myself. Um, which is actually I've got a

slide that kind of covers it in in big

words, so I'll throw that up. Um, and

then I'll I'll just talk through some of

my career. So, yeah, I've been in email

very similar to everyone in the

industry. I fell into it and I have not

been able to leave it. I don't know why

I like it so much. I just really enjoy

it. But I've been an email since 2015

uh about a year before I even joined

customer.io as an employee. I had a call

with uh one of the senior product

leaders just talking about my love of

email and how I'm vocal in the industry

and he was like, "Well, if you ever want

a job, like come chat to me." I was

like, "I don't know what I would do at

Customer.io. I'm I'm a marketer that

likes to do email." And then about a

year later, I joined the team. And it's

really cool for me because I really

enjoy the community that we sit in as

email life cycle growth marketers. I'm

an enduser of the tool and then that

combination I can kind of help shape the

road map based on what people like us

need. So yeah, I love my job. I love

what I do here. And I'm technically my

title is a product marketer. Uh although

I'm still like hanging on to the title

of life cycle marketer for dear life not

clawed away from me because I still

believe that a lot of what I do is life

cycle but instead of looking at how do I

generate more top of funnel or how do I

you know create sticky retention I'm

like

>> how do I get people to use the product

and what can I do to get feedback on the

product. I'm a horrible salesperson. I'm

like, if you want to use the tool, you

can use the tool, but I want to know if

you like using the tool and if you don't

like using it, what we can do better.

And so,

>> yeah,

>> thrive in my position.

>> When I joined Drift, Naomi, they gave me

a product marketing title because I was

a customer of Drift before I joined.

>> And they did the same thing where I had

never had a product marketing title.

Yeah. And they were like, well, we don't

really know what to do with you, but you

can do a lot of stuff. You know, the

product, we think you're going to do

like marketing the product, so we'll

call you a product marketing manager.

That's kind of I can I know that

experience. Yeah,

>> that's pretty much exactly what happened

to me, too. I was like, I don't know

what product marketing

>> Yeah.

>> does. I know life cycle and I know email

and I know this community and they're

like, here's a product marketing title.

I'm like, okay. All right. Here we go.

>> So, let's do it. So, so you're actually

doing some of these these these

campaigns you were showing us earlier

the week um some of the types of

engagements and campaigns you're running

for customer.io. This is like how the

sausages is made behind the scenes here.

like it sounds like you have a couple

examples you wanted to show us today.

>> Yeah. Yeah, I've got a couple examples

that I want to walk through and um again

just hitting home that even though my

title isn't life cycle or email, I'm

still very much so a life cycle marketer

of sorts. I'm encouraging adoption of

the platform. I sit within the marketing

team. I have very specific things that I

want from the people that I email or

send inapp messages to. Uh, and just to

give a quick look of like what the team

kind of seems like at at customer.io.

So, we have a very large marketing team.

I think in total there's like 30 or 40

of us now. When I joined there was only

nine or 11. It was a much smaller number

when I joined. Um, four years ago and

now we're a much larger team. But on the

team there still is that traditional

like growth marketing life cycle

function. And this team of five

marketers, five growth life cycle

marketers, they own onboarding, they own

awareness, they own the upsell, they own

like referral techniques. They're there

really the core foundation of um the

traditional role of a life cycle

marketer. They're they're executing on

that. And then I am one of five product

marketers. And we each kind of have our

own area of specialty. I come from a

background of loving email marketing

specifically and so with that I own uh

our design studio which is kind of our

email editor and marketing that and then

with kind of this new adoption of AI in

our industry uh I have also decided to

own kind of like our AI features and how

we deliver them to our audience base. So

those are kind of like my areas of focus

within the organization. But of course

there's a million other features of of

customer.io. Uh and as product marketers

we own launches and education and

awareness for those product areas. So I

sit kind of in that that second column

there. Now I want to walk through um two

examples specifically but what I believe

to be customer engagement is yeah it's

awareness it's activation it's top of

funnel it's retention but it's also how

you find out if what you built is

working and I love like a small startup

environment I thrive in a really

fast-paced motion um where the CEO is

like on calls with customers and you're

learning about what works but at some

stage I don't know like what stage of

user base it occurs that like feedback

loop between the CEO that shapes the

product direction or the product team

shaping that product direction at some

level of scale

that feedback loop almost breaks at

companies and that's where Jira tickets

start to pop up and zenes tickets start

to pop up and there's not really this

connection point between the enduser

experience and the marketing team that's

talking about these features or like the

product team that's you know reading

these support tickets. You have to play

telephone in order to get that. And I as

an individual like refuse to do that.

I'm like as a marketer I want people to

reply to me like please reply. Makes my

day even if someone's like I'm

frustrated. I'm like but why? Tell me

more. Uh and so the two examples that I

want to walk through um are going to

kind of talk through how I implement

touch points to drive that feedback

loop.

The first is our MCP server. So about a

year ago at customer, we launched our

MCP server. If you're not familiar with

what an MCP server is, I view it as just

like a new term we use for integrating

AI tools with products. Um, so you can

integrate an LLM such as Claude or

Cursor or Chad GPT with tools like

customer.io or notion. And now 90% of my

workday as a marketer I just spend in

claude and I use an MCP server to create

new pages in notion. I'm like create

this page on why customer has a good

product and I will use this page to

communicate out with users um and share

it widely internally. Um so that MCP

server is essentially that connection

point. But the one thing with launching

an MCP server is I can't necessarily see

what our end users are doing in Claude

or Cursor or ChatgBT. I can't see what

they're commanding that LLM to do inside

of customer IO. And so I really need

kind of a a life cycle marketing touch

point to be like how is your experience

since I have no visibility into it like

through backend events um or conversion

events. Let's say I need them to reply

back to me. So what I did is I'm just

going to jump over. I have as soon as an

admin turns on the MCP server in a

user's account, I have individuals enter

into this onboarding flow. So after 25

minutes, usually I would kind of expect

action to be taken quite quickly between

enabling it as a feature and an enduser

going to connect to something like clott

cursor. I reach out to users after 25

minutes and I have this simple like

let's get you connected to some LLMs uh

to kind of guide that process and this

first email looks like such. So I send

this email out and I'm like welcome to

our MCP server. You are basically part

of this group now that's using MCP to

connect to Claude and Chat GPT and

cursor and here's like the setup guide.

So, instead of having to comb through a

bunch of our docs in order for you to

quickly access this or connect it, um,

here's the information right in front of

you. And it's interesting because I

actually get quite a lot of responses

back either being like, "Ah, I was able

to connect this super quickly. Thanks so

much." Or like, "Hey, what other prompts

do you have that I could use with the

product?"

And that type of information is either a

signal that things are working really

well for me, which I'm like, perfect, we

don't need to change anything here, or

hey, these questions that I'm getting

back from end users, I should use to

shape the next touch point or just

reintegrate into this first one because

people are having these questions right

off the bat. So,

this is my first touch point. Jumping

back to kind of what this workflow looks

like. Um, up until yesterday, I had a

second email go out after a day, but I'm

working on redoing this one. So, it's

been paused since then. But then I have

this third email that basically connects

to the user asking them how their

experience was. Um, kind of after a 3 4

day period.

So, I jump into their inbox again and

all replies go to me. They do not go to

a Zenesk ticket. They go to me because I

am like a megaphone internally sharing

any questions and concerns with the

product team. Of course, if like a bug

pops up, I'll share it with our um like

support team that can help debug. Um but

for the most part, I just want to know

like real marketer feedback of what they

want and what they're using. And I find

actually the way that we've templated

out this feedback uh results in quite a

lot of responses. People will literally

take this and then write in like a

tabbed format underneath answering my

questions, which is super helpful for me

to take that feedback back to the team.

Um the ways in which I've been able to

take this uh kind of response to whether

it's the first email or this third one

or even the second one we had it launch

um is we initially launched our MCP

server with only read capabilities about

a year ago. Uh so you could ask it for

uh data around your campaigns, your

broadcasts. You could ask it for

information on a user profile. You could

say based on this specific user, create

like a lookalike audience for me. Who

should I be targeting based on what this

really successful user does? But the

create capabilities weren't there yet.

So, we have been behind the scenes

chipping away creating create

capabilities so that individuals will be

able to create broadcasts and campaigns.

Hopefully, we're launching it around

next week. Um, but this is really what

we've heard in response. people are like

the read capabilities are great but we

want to create um and so if it wasn't

for feedback like that we would just be

like it's silent everyone loves it and

so we don't need to do anything more

here we can just let the feature be uh

and carry on our merry way so feedback

helps shape our product

>> I love that a a company of your scale

Naomi is one email is still the crown

jewel communication tool like thank you

for validating that for the 11,000th

time that we've done one of these

sessions or a session, any session we've

done, like email is still our number one

go-to channel, even with, you know,

everything else that's out there.

>> Um, and then two, um, you're, you know,

you're looking for just replies like to

an email, you know, like you beautifully

HTML like it's not like click here, go

here, fill out this form or take this

survey or let's get this data point.

Like you're looking for the fastest

feedback loop possible, which is like

and also it goes all to you directly,

right? you're taking it in, ingesting

it, and you're the engine for helping

take that data and analyze it and push

it within the team. Like, I just I think

that's I hopefully the rest of the

audience here is picking up on that,

too. But customer is a very successful

company and a pretty big 35 people on

their team on their marketing team

alone.

>> They're looking for email replies for

for data. We're letting humans kind of

analyze it and get that fast feedback

loop. I think that's a really good

important thing to call out here.

>> In in other roles, too, this would be

the most unsuccessful email ever because

there is no clickthrough rate.

>> Yeah. Once you're through like

unsubscribing or like going through a

social link in the footer, my

click-through rate is so low because

there's nowhere to click.

>> Yeah.

>> But I have to shift my like success

metrics when I'm looking at the results

of this email and be like, I got this

many replies and 10% of them were

feature requests, 10% of them were

praise, like categorizing it that way

and like look at how this feedback then

shaped the rest of our product. And I

like I love it. I love it.

Um, I want to run one through run

through one more example. I know we're

almost at time here, but I'll be quick.

The second uh kind of email outreach

that I have instrumented as part of my

role as a PMM is uh helping shape our

beta programs. And I really enjoy

features that are in beta because you

get more feedback than you have ever

before. It's almost this like contract

where you're saying this thing is in

beta and we want to hear you yell about

its imperfections

and the changes that you want because

we're still in this phase where things

could drastically change. Um, after you

launch something and you make a big

splash about it, I find frustrated

users, they get grumpy or they turn

quietly and they don't communicate why.

But if something's in beta, people are

going to be like, "Hey, I know this was

recently released in beta, and here's

what I need." Like, "This is a bug. I

understand it's in beta." Or like, "Hey,

are you are you still working on this

thing? Like, I really want this as like

a feature request."

And so, what we have is

a year and a bit ago, we launched Design

Studio, which is essentially uh in the

lefthand nav here in Custom.io, you'll

see design studio. It's a new email

editor.

Um, and we launched it quite early

before I would say we had the amount of

features that I would even want uh as a

marketer myself. But since then, since

over the past year and a half, we've

been adding so much stuff into it. And

it's email outreach that essentially

drives that that feedback loop. Um, we

had definitely a road map of items that

we knew we were going to add throughout

the beta experience, but when we hear

from customers requests of what they

want, we are constantly adding them into

the next sprint. And that feedback kind

of is is a result of touch points like

this. It's just a simple email from

myself that again is like okay here's

like a quick overview of what you can do

in design studio but like reply back

with questions or comments. So although

we do have an inproduct kind of like

capture of people leaving feedback I get

a ton of replies from this like at least

20 to 30 a week and some of them again

are like hey I I want to learn how to do

this and then I'm like okay that's not

clear in the product how can we make

that experience better. Um, so even just

general questions. There's no such thing

as a stupid question in my books because

email is tricky. It's a straightforward

channel, but it's tricky to execute

sometimes. And I want the product that I

represent to be as easy as possible to

to use. So touch points like this text

based. They don't need like a fluffy

lifestyle image are really easy to just

get out the door and and get sent to to

users. So that's my spiel of the the

second email that we've we've sent. And

that email's been running for a year and

a half now, and it still gathers great

feedback every single day. So, just to

wrap up kind of like my long- winded

chat here of how I implement life cycle

and customer engagement points uh at

customer.io is I really don't think you

need a full CS team or like a research

program to close the feedback loop. You

just need the right message and the

willingness to to listen. Sometimes it

can be hard at scale, but if you break

it up into kind of like bite-sized

pieces like I have, it's digestible and

it's usually really valuable to the

business. And that's that.

>> Awesome.

>> Thanks, Naomi. All right, don't go

anywhere. You can stop sharing your

screen, though. That's okay. We're going

to invite Jonathan and we're going to

invite Sue back up to the stage. Um, if

anyone has a question for Naomi of what

she just presented, please put it in the

chat. Um, it looks like I can use my

window now. So, now I can see Okay,

nothing in the Q&A panel. That's fine.

Um, there was a question earlier. I'm

going to go back first uh to a question

that came up for Sue. Um this question

is from Pat Sue. How far into your

trial, remember um uh refresher the

referral program in the trial and

earlier on in the trial is what Sue was

presenting. How far back in your trial

did you find a sweet spot for

communicating referral program or s our

system is pretty complex and we have

60-day onboarding period. curious if we

should wait until that's completely over

or if we potentially should start during

the onboarding period and extend a bit

beyond. Uh Sue, what do you think?

>> This is exactly the question that we had

before we started the referral program,

which is why we tap the data team. I

know this is the standard answer, but uh

I think you should do the analysis with

your data team on when referrals happen

organically the most and kind of double

down on that. And I think you'll be even

if you have a 60-day window, I think

you'll be surprised. It seems like uh

the consumer mindset, they're more price

sensitive or just it price is just top

of their mind when they're starting

their trial. Um so I would guess that

earlier would be better.

>> Yeah. And test it, try it out, right?

And see see what it is. You could always

try to find a limited way of testing it,

I'm sure. Um jumping forward to

Jonathan's question, John, the questions

that came in for Jonathan, I should say.

Uh, I believe Jonathan answered most of

those. Uh, Jonathan, was there any that

you wanted to expand upon that you

didn't get to fully answer in chat that

you would want to answer with with a mic

in your hand, so to speak?

>> Um, I don't think anything has not been

said already. I think the net net of it

is is that any any time you're doing

something new for the first time or

you're expanding on a strategy or doing

things differently, all of it's hard,

right? So really the intention was not

to say this is easy. It really was about

like sometimes the hard stuff is what

you should be doing.

>> Yeah.

>> Um you know somebody asked about scaling

customer education. It's incredibly

difficult scale. It's actually

unscalable, right? you'd have to hire

more people to do those trainings

because our customer education team, uh,

we have two of them. They're building

the decks, they're doing the live

presentations, they're answering the

questions, they are, you know, sending

those videos to Vimeo, and they're doing

all the behind the scenes stuff. Um, and

it's pretty taxing. So, not easy, not

necessarily scalable, but worthwhile.

>> All right. Um, where I just I'm I'm

jumping over to Slack to tell Allison to

run the poll. In the spirit of feedback

and growth marketing, inspired by We

always do this, but inspired by Naomi

looking for feedback. Sue looking for

feedback, Jonathan looking for feedback.

We're going to ask for feedback on this

session today. If you could jump in and

rate today's session, um, five being the

best uh, 60 minutes of your week, one

being you're putting together a lawsuit

for the 60 minutes that you just lost. I

don't know, whatever it is. One one's

not good, five is really good. Give us a

quick rating. That's very helpful. Um,

we appreciate everybody uh spending time

with us today. Hopefully this was

helpful. Um, there was some great

questions that came through. Um, and it

was awesome to hear from Sue, Naomi, and

Jonathan um on the different uh the

different programs and campaigns and

lots of data, lot like we're doing more

of these sessions. We're sharing, you

know, examples and visuals and it's

getting more and more interesting to

like just pull up your slides and just

show me, you know, what what you what

you would show your board, right? We

talked about that earlier in the week

and so it's really fun to see like

inside each of these companies and see

what you're doing. So, thank you to the

three of you for spending time with us

this week and our audience sharing all

of that.

>> Thanks for having us.

>> All right, everybody. Talk to you soon.

Thanks for thanks for the time. Bye.

Hear me.
